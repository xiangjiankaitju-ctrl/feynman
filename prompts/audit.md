Audit the paper and codebase for: $@

Requirements:
- Use the `researcher` subagent for evidence gathering and the `verifier` subagent to verify sources and add inline citations when the audit is non-trivial.
- Compare claimed methods, defaults, metrics, and data handling against the actual code.
- Call out missing code, mismatches, ambiguous defaults, and reproduction risks.
- Save exactly one audit artifact to `outputs/` as markdown.
- End with a `Sources` section containing paper and repository URLs.
